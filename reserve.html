<!-- EXCERCISE 1 -->

<!-- Write code to implement the claim reservation feature:

X Prompt the user for their name (code already given)

X Check if there is a reservation under that name

X Translation: Check if the name is a property of the reservations object

X You should use the concept of truthy/falsey values

X If the reservation exists and is unclaimed, welcome the user

X If the reservation exists and is already claimed, inform the user about the situation

X If there is no reservation, tell the user there is nothing under their name

HINT: You are given one reservation in the reservations object. Use the name Billy when testing your code. -->

<!-- EXCERCISE 2 -->

<!-- Write code to implement the make a reservation feature:

X Prompt the user for a name (code already given)

X Check if there is a reservation under that name

X Keep in mind claimed and unclaimed reservations

If there exists an unclaimed reservation under that name, inform the user that they need to use a different name

If the reservation has been claimed, it's name is no longer reserved

Otherwise create the reservation -->
